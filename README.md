# CSCI158-Applied-Biometric-Security-FRESNO-STATE

Project for CSCI 158 Applied Biometric Security - Fresno State - Spring 2024

Applied security systems and biometrics. Principles of biometrics, the pattern recognition nature of biometric systems, different forms of biometrics, such as fingerprint, face, gait, keystroke etc.. Topics include feature extraction and implementation of authentication systems for biometric data, performance evaluation of biometrics systems, spoofing attacks of biometrics and spoof prevention methods. Some foundational classifiers and their use and vulnerabilities in biometric systems are also covered.


In this project we have the libraries of librosa, pydub, and tensorflow all used for downloading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and manipulating our data. With the following principles, we tried to make a real time voice detection system and see if it can detect our voice. In efforts of doing this we wanted to see if we could spoof the detection systen to have figmented audio snippet also be detect by the machine and act as a proxy intrusion, almost like a replay attack yet with made up audio snippets.
