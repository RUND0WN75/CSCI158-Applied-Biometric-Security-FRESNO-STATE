# CSCI158-Applied-Biometric-Security-FRESNO-STATE

Project for CSCI 158 Applied Biometric Security - Fresno State - Spring 2024

Applied security systems and biometrics. Principles of biometrics, the pattern recognition nature of biometric systems, different forms of biometrics, such as fingerprint, face, gait, keystroke etc.. Topics include feature extraction and implementation of authentication systems for biometric data, performance evaluation of biometrics systems, spoofing attacks of biometrics and spoof prevention methods. Some foundational classifiers and their use and vulnerabilities in biometric systems are also covered.
